# Knight's Travails

Knight's Travails is a JavaScript implementation of the classic chess problem where a knight must find the shortest path from one square to another on an 8x8 chessboard. This project demonstrates the use of breadth-first search (BFS) for pathfinding and object-oriented programming principles.
